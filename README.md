## Description

This project is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database for data storage, and the Mongoose ODM for modeling and interacting with MongoDB.

## Technologies

1. Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs and web applications.

2. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility, making it ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured data.

3. Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a straightforward schema-based solution for modeling application data.

4. Insomnia: A popular API testing tool that enables developers to design, debug, and test APIs more efficiently.
